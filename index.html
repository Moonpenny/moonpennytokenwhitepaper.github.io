			The digital world is becoming a sure thing in everyone’s life year after year, everyone knows this, big
	financial institutions are making their way in the crypto space dragging everyone’s attention. There
	are thousands of choices, but there are only a few winners. You would not want to put all your life
	savings in a token that has nothing behind it, you would risk waking up next day and realise that all
	your money were gone.<br> However, there are many attractive tokens that have great teams behind
	them and are making sure there is growth and continuity for their projects. You would really want to
	invest in this kind of projects that can guarantee each investor there are benefits attached to their
	investments, and even more you would make sure to invest early so will enjoy more benefits along
	the way. The benefits are closely linked to the utility of such tokens.
		</p>
		<p class="chapter-content text-center">
			What if apart from the token price continuous appreciation you would receive passive income?
		</p>
		<p class="chapter-content text-center">
			This is where Moonpenny comes in. It is frictionless yield and liquidity generation smart contract
	protocol that works by applying 10% fee for each transaction and instantly splitting that fee by
	rewarding holders with 5% and auto locking 5% in Pancake LP. Holders can enjoy earning rewards by
	just holding Moonpenny tokens in their wallets. Contract allows to exclude certain addresses like
	PancakeSwap from receiving rewards, as well allow to include certain address to receive reward if
	required.

					<p class="chapter-content">Buying Moonpenny will ensure you of having invested your money in a project that is going to multiply
		your investment over time. By just HODL-ing you are making more money than any bank can offer as
		interest or compound interest return. Not only compared to banks, but the passive reward system
		that Moonpenny holders benefit from is even better than burns and buy-backs systems, there are
		burns taking place in Moonpenny as well.</p>
					<p class="chapter-content">
						The team is working tirelessly on producing best projects that have the potential of lifting this to
		new heights. There is a vision and a devoted team that is using their amazing skills in a creative way
		to achieve success.
					</p>
					<p class="chapter-content">We are not looking to pump this token’s price without having done our work first, any hype without
		logic is usually doomed to fail. Therefore, we would like to prove ourselves first and success will
		follow.		</p>
					<p class="chapter-content">
					Soon after creating this token we try to gather over 20,000 holders, apply for an exchange
		listing, get into the top gainers on CoinMarketCap, and work hard to build a top-notch website.
					</p>
					<p class="chapter-content">
						If these are not enough, keep in mind that there is more to come, as we have plans to create our
		own merchandise, develop partnerships, integrate NFT’s, and much more.

					The main thing about Moonpenny is that it runs a smart code that takes away 10% of each buy or sale
	transaction and sends 5% to the LP, and the 5% is split among all holders, on the proportional basis,
	so the more you hold, the more you receive as passive income. This ensures you are getting passive
	income along with the continuous price appreciation.
